-Lookup subject line and sender/recipients to see if existing event has already been created (subject lines should be saved in DB to help with lookup in case event title changes)
-Event created named "Birthday Party"
-duggster@gmail.com set as Organizer, status IN
-other To/cc recipients added as guests, status PENDING
-body of email parsed for unique conversations and senders
-each conversation added as posted message
-email alias/route created: <GUID>@pbj.mailgun.com
-email response sent from pbj-BirthdayPa-<GUID>@pbj.mailgun.com to everyone with message and link to PBJ event site
-Allow organizer to log in and customize before sending link to everyone?
-Email sender with options?

-if subject line exists for event that matches guest list (50% match?), then goto route handler for event
-email sender so they can update their recipient list to include new email handle, and remove new@pbj
